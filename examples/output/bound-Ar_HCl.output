  SEGMENT 1 WILL BE PROPAGATED OUTWARDS

  FROM RMIN =      2.70 TO RMATCH =      4.00

  COUPLED EQUATIONS SOLVED BY DIABATIC MODIFIED LOG-DERIVATIVE PROPAGATOR OF MANOLOPOULOS

  PROPAGATION STEP SIZE DETERMINED USING DR =  4.000E-02
  STEP SIZE CONSTANT THROUGHOUT RANGE
  STEP SIZE MAY BE ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY SO THAT RANGE IS A WHOLE NUMBER OF STEPS

  PROGRAM WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVERGE ON BOUND STATES AS A FUNCTION OF ENERGY

  FOR EACH LEVEL, THE BISECTION METHOD WILL BE USED UNTIL THE VWDB METHOD OFFERS RELIABLE CONVERGENCE.

  VWDB CONVERGENCE WILL TERMINATE WHEN THE STEP SIZE IS LESS THAN 1.00000E-08 CM-1    

  INPUT ENERGY VALUES ASSUMED TO BE IN UNITS OF CM-1 BY DEFAULT.

  PROGRAM WILL SEEK EIGENVALUES WITH GENERALISED NODE COUNTS FROM    0 TO  99999
