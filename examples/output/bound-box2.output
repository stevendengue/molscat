  PROPAGATION METHODS FOR COUPLED EQUATIONS SPECIFIED BY IPROPS =  6 AND IPROPL =  9

  COUPLED EQUATIONS WILL BE PROPAGATED TOWARDS RMATCH IN 2 SEGMENTS

  PROPAGATION RANGES ARE CONTROLLED BY VARIABLES RMIN, RMATCH AND RMAX, WITH INPUT VALUES
  RMIN =  1.0000E-08 RMATCH =   2.000     RMAX =   3.142    
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  SEGMENT 1 WILL BE PROPAGATED OUTWARDS

  FROM RMIN =      0.00 TO RMATCH =      2.00

  COUPLED EQUATIONS SOLVED BY DIABATIC MODIFIED LOG-DERIVATIVE PROPAGATOR OF MANOLOPOULOS

  PROPAGATION STEP SIZE DETERMINED USING DR =  1.000E-03
  STEP SIZE CONSTANT THROUGHOUT RANGE
  STEP SIZE MAY BE ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY SO THAT RANGE IS A WHOLE NUMBER OF STEPS

  LOG-DERIVATIVE MATRIX INITIALISED IN THE LOCAL EIGENBASIS AT RMIN IN THE OUTWARD PROPAGATION PART
  LOCALLY CLOSED CHANNELS INITIALISED WITH THE VALUE  1.000E+00
  LOCALLY  OPEN  CHANNELS INITIALISED WITH THE VALUE  1.000E-01

  SEGMENT 2 WILL BE PROPAGATED  INWARDS

  TO RMATCH =      2.00 FROM RMAX =      3.14

  COUPLED EQUATIONS SOLVED BY VARIABLE-STEP AIRY PROPAGATOR.
  PUBLICATIONS RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS PROPAGATOR SHOULD REFERENCE

  PROPAGATION STEP SIZE DETERMINED USING DR =  1.000E-03
  STEP SIZES ADJUSTED TO MAINTAIN APPROXIMATE ACCURACY VIA PERTURBATION THEORY

  PROGRAM WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVERGE ON BOUND STATES AS A FUNCTION OF ENERGY

  FOR EACH LEVEL, THE BISECTION METHOD WILL BE USED UNTIL THE VWDB METHOD OFFERS RELIABLE CONVERGENCE.

  VWDB CONVERGENCE WILL TERMINATE WHEN THE STEP SIZE IS LESS THAN 1.00000E-07 CM-1    

  INPUT ENERGY VALUES ASSUMED TO BE IN UNITS OF CM-1 BY DEFAULT.

  PROGRAM WILL SEEK EIGENVALUES WITH GENERALISED NODE COUNTS FROM    0 TO  99999
