  PROPAGATION METHODS FOR COUPLED EQUATIONS SPECIFIED BY IPROPS =  8 AND IPROPL =  8

  COUPLED EQUATIONS WILL BE PROPAGATED TOWARDS RMATCH IN 2 SEGMENTS

  PROPAGATION RANGES ARE CONTROLLED BY VARIABLES RMIN, RMATCH AND RMAX, WITH INPUT VALUES
  RMIN =  0.5000     RMATCH =   1.000     RMAX =   20.00

  SEGMENT 1 WILL BE PROPAGATED OUTWARDS

  FROM RMIN =      0.50 TO RMATCH =      1.00

  COUPLED EQUATIONS SOLVED BY SYMPLECTIC LOG-DERIVATIVE PROPAGATOR OF MANOLOPOULOS AND GRAY
  USING THE SIX-STEP FIFTH-ORDER METHOD OF MCLACHLAN AND ATELA

  PROPAGATION STEP SIZE DETERMINED USING DR =  1.000E-03
  STEP SIZE CONSTANT THROUGHOUT RANGE
  STEP SIZE MAY BE ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY SO THAT RANGE IS A WHOLE NUMBER OF STEPS

  PROGRAM WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVERGE ON BOUND STATES AS A FUNCTION OF ENERGY

  FOR EACH LEVEL, THE BISECTION METHOD WILL BE USED UNTIL THE VWDB METHOD OFFERS RELIABLE CONVERGENCE.

  VWDB CONVERGENCE WILL TERMINATE WHEN THE STEP SIZE IS LESS THAN 1.00000E-07 CM-1    

  INPUT ENERGY VALUES ASSUMED TO BE IN UNITS OF CM-1 BY DEFAULT.

  PROGRAM WILL SEEK EIGENVALUES WITH GENERALISED NODE COUNTS FROM    0 TO  99999
